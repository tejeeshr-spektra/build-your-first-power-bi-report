# Publish, Share, and Enhance User Experience in Power BI

### Overall Estimated Duration: 2 Hours

## 📘 Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will take a pre-built Power BI report — the **Item Sales Report**, provided for you in the lab environment — on its next journey — from a local `.pbix` file on your desktop to a fully published, shareable, and visually polished business asset in the Power BI Service.

You will begin by publishing the report and its semantic model to the Power BI Service, pinning its key visuals into an **Executive Dashboard**, exploring the three primary sharing methods (workspace roles, direct sharing, and apps), and configuring **scheduled refresh** so the data stays current without manual effort. You will then return to the report itself and apply professional design polish — layout grids, themes, conditional formatting, branded design elements, custom AppSource visuals, interactive tooltips, bookmarks, buttons, and finally an AI-generated narrative summary using **Copilot in Power BI**.

By the end of this lab, you will have transformed a working report into a board-ready, interactive analytics experience that is published, shared, refreshed, and enhanced according to modern Power BI best practices.

## 📋 Objective

This lab is designed to equip participants with hands-on experience in publishing, sharing, and enhancing Power BI content in the Power BI Service. By completing this lab, you will learn to:

- **Publish and Share Your Work**: Publish a Power BI Desktop report to the Power BI Service, build a dashboard by pinning report visuals, review workspace roles and sharing methods (direct sharing, links, and apps), and configure scheduled refresh for the published semantic model.
- **Create a Visually Engaging Dashboard**: Apply a layout grid and theme with brand colours, add conditional formatting to highlight insights, enhance the page with backgrounds, shapes, and subtle design elements, import custom visuals from AppSource, add tooltips, bookmarks, and buttons for interactivity, and generate a narrative summary with Copilot.

## ✅ Pre-requisites

Participants should have the following prerequisites before starting this lab:

- **Item Sales Report (`.pbix`)**: A pre-built starter report is provided for you at **C:\LabFiles** on the lab virtual machine — no prior lab or setup is required.
- **Basic familiarity with Power BI Desktop**: Understanding of report pages, visuals, and the Visualizations pane.
- **Basic understanding of the Power BI Service**: Awareness of workspaces, reports, dashboards, and semantic models (datasets).

> **Note**: Some features used in this lab — sharing, app publishing, scheduled refresh, AppSource visuals, and Copilot — depend on tenant settings, licensing, and administrator permissions. Where a feature is not available in the lab environment, the guide instructs you to review the option and document the dependency instead.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The workflow in this lab follows the standard Power BI publish-and-share lifecycle. A report authored in **Power BI Desktop** is published to a **workspace** in the **Power BI Service**, where it is stored alongside its **semantic model**. Key visuals from the report are pinned as tiles to a **dashboard** for an at-a-glance executive view. Content is then distributed to consumers through **workspace roles**, **direct sharing links**, or a packaged **Power BI app**, while **scheduled refresh** keeps the semantic model up to date from its data source. Finally, the report itself is enhanced in Power BI Desktop with themes, conditional formatting, custom visuals from **AppSource**, interactive elements (tooltips, bookmarks, buttons), and an AI-generated narrative from **Copilot**, and the updated version is republished to the Service.

## 🔍 Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Power BI Desktop**: The free authoring tool where reports are designed, enhanced, and published from. In this lab it is used to open the existing report, apply design polish, add custom visuals and interactivity, and publish to the Service.
- **Power BI Service**: The cloud-based (SaaS) platform where published content lives. It hosts workspaces, reports, dashboards, semantic models, and apps, and provides sharing, refresh, and Copilot capabilities.
- **Workspace**: A collaborative container in the Power BI Service that stores related reports, dashboards, and semantic models, with role-based access control (Admin, Member, Contributor, Viewer).
- **Semantic Model (Dataset)**: The published data model behind the report. It holds the tables, relationships, and measures, and is the object on which scheduled refresh is configured.
- **Dashboard**: A single-page canvas in the Power BI Service composed of tiles pinned from one or more reports, designed for at-a-glance monitoring.
- **Power BI App**: A packaged, read-only distribution mechanism that bundles reports and dashboards for a broad audience with controlled navigation and permissions.
- **AppSource Custom Visuals**: Third-party and Microsoft-built visuals that extend the native visualization library with additional chart types such as gauges, KPI indicators, and word clouds.
- **Copilot in Power BI**: An AI assistant that can generate narrative summaries and insights from report pages, subject to licensing (Fabric capacity) and tenant settings.
