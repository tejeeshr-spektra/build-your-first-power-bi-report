# Exercise 1: Publish and Share Your Work

### Estimated Duration: 60 Minutes

## 📘 Scenario

The **StorePerformanceReport** — a pre-built `.pbix` file provided in your lab environment — currently lives only in Power BI Desktop on your lab machine. Contoso Retail's leadership team wants this report available in the cloud — viewable from any device, summarized in a single executive dashboard, shared with the right people at the right permission level, and refreshed automatically every day.

In this exercise, you will move your report to the Power BI Service and make it available to your audience: you will publish the report and its semantic model, build a dashboard from its key visuals, review the three primary sharing methods, and configure scheduled refresh.

## 🎯 Objectives

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Launch the environment and open your working report
- Task 2: Power BI Service – Creating a Workspace
- Task 3: Publish from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI Service
- Task 4: Build a dashboard from report tiles
- Task 5: Configure sharing (workspace roles, apps, links)
- Task 6: Set up scheduled refresh

    ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T2S8.png)

## Task 3: Publish from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI Service

In this task, you will publish your report — and the semantic model behind it — from Power BI Desktop into a workspace in the Power BI Service. Publishing is the moment your report stops being a local file and becomes a shared cloud asset.

1. In Power BI Desktop, verify from the top-right corner of the window that you are signed in with your organizational account:

   - **Account:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

     ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T3S1.png)

1. From the **Home (1)** tab in the top ribbon, click on **Publish (2)** to publish your report to the Power BI Service.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T3S2.png)

1. If prompted to save your changes first, click **Save**.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T3S3.png)

1. In the **Publish to Power BI** dialog box, select the destination workspace **Workspace-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** and click **Select (2)**.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T3S4.png)

1. Wait for the publishing process to complete. A success message appears when it is done.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T3S5.png)

1. On the success message, click **Open 'StorePerformanceReport.pbix' in Power BI** to open the published report in the browser.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T3S6.png)

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Workspaces (1)** and open **Workspace-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T3S7.png)

1. Verify that the workspace now contains **both** of the following items:

   - The **StorePerformanceReport** (type: Report)
   - The **StorePerformanceReport** semantic model (type: Semantic model)

      ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T3S8.png)

   > **Note**: The semantic model is published automatically alongside the report. It holds the data, relationships, and measures, and is the object you will configure for scheduled refresh in Task 6.

## Task 4: Build a dashboard from report tiles

In this task, you will create a consolidated executive view by pinning key report visuals to a new dashboard. Unlike a report, a dashboard is a single-page canvas that can combine tiles from multiple reports — ideal for at-a-glance monitoring by leadership.

1. In the Power BI Service, from the workspace, open the **StorePerformanceReport**.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T4S1.png)

1. Navigate to the first report page and identify a visual that represents a key business metric, such as the item-wise sales bar chart.

1. Hover over the visual and select the **Pin visual** icon from the visual header.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T4S2.png)

1. In the **Pin to dashboard** window, select **New dashboard (1)** and enter the following name **(2)**, then click **Pin (3)**:

   ```
   Executive Dashboard
   ```

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T4S3.png)

1. When the **Pinned to dashboard** confirmation appears, close it and remain on the report.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T4S3.png)

1. Repeat the pinning process for additional visuals — this time, in the **Pin to dashboard** window, select **Existing dashboard (1)**, ensure **Executive Dashboard (2)** is selected, and click **Pin (3)**.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T4S5.png)

1. Pin **at least four visuals** in total, from this page or other report pages, so that together they provide a meaningful executive summary (for example: total revenue, top items by quantity, a trend over time, and a KPI or card visual).

1. In the left navigation pane, select your workspace and open the **Executive Dashboard**.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T4S6.png)

1. Rearrange and resize the tiles by dragging them, so the layout reads cleanly — place the single most important metric at the top-left, where the eye lands first.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T4S7.png)

## Task 5: Configure sharing (workspace roles, apps, links)

In this task, you will review the three primary ways to share content in the Power BI Service — **workspace access** (roles for collaborators), **direct item sharing** (links and invitations for specific reports or dashboards), and **apps** (a packaged, read-only experience for broad audiences) — and understand when to use each.

1. In the Power BI Service, return to **Workspace-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** and review its contents.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T5S1.png)

1. From the upper-right corner of the workspace, click **Manage access**.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T5S2.png)

1. In the **Manage access** pane, review the four available workspace roles:

   - **Admin** — full control, including managing workspace access and settings
   - **Member** — can edit, publish, and share content
   - **Contributor** — can create and edit content, but cannot manage access
   - **Viewer** — can only view and interact with content.

1. Click **+ Add people or groups (1)**, enter a test user or group provided in your lab instructions, set the permission to **Viewer (2)** using the dropdown, and click **Add (3)**.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T5S4.png)

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T5S5.png)

1. Open the **StorePerformanceReport (1)** and, from the top menu, click **Share (2)**.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T5S6.png)

1. In the **Send link** dialog, review the available direct sharing options:

   - **Sharing with specific people** — enter a name or email to send an invitation
   - **Copy link** — generate a shareable link with configurable permissions
   - **Link settings** — control whether recipients can share further or build content on the underlying data

     ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T5S7.png)

1. Click the **link settings (gear/pencil) icon**, review the audience options — **People in your organization**, **People with existing access**, and **Specific people** — and the additional permissions checkboxes, then click **Apply**.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T5S8.png)

1. Close the sharing dialog and return to the workspace.

1. From the workspace toolbar, click **Create app**.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T5S9.png)

1. On the **Setup** tab, review and configure the following:

   - **App name (1)**: `Contoso Executive Insights`
   - **Description (2)**: `Board-ready sales insights for the Contoso executive team.`
   - Click **Next: Add content (3)**

     ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T5S10.png)

1. On the **Content** tab, click **+ Add content (1)**, select the **StorePerformanceReport** and the **Executive Dashboard (2)**, click **Add (3)**, and review the navigation order, then click **Next: Add audience (4)**.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T5S11.png)

1. On the **Audience** tab, review how audiences control who sees which content, and review the audience access options.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T5S12.png)

1. If your environment allows app publishing, click **Publish app** and confirm.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T5S13.png)

## Task 6: Set up scheduled refresh

In this task, you will configure the published semantic model to refresh on a schedule so that the report and dashboard always reflect current data without any manual steps.

1. In the workspace, locate the **StorePerformanceReport** semantic model.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T6S1.png)

1. Hover over the semantic model, click the **More options (…) (1)** menu, and select **Settings (2)**.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T6S2.png)

1. On the settings page, review the available sections:

   - **Gateway and cloud connections**
   - **Data source credentials**
   - **Refresh** (scheduled refresh)
   - **Refresh history** (accessible from the Refresh section or the semantic model's Refresh menu)

     ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T6S3.png)

1. Expand **Data source credentials** and verify whether authentication is required for the data source.

1. If a credentials warning is displayed, click **Edit credentials (1)**, provide the appropriate **Authentication method (2)** for the lab data source, set the **Privacy level (3)** if prompted, and click **Sign in / Save (4)**.

   ![](./Images/L2E1T5S3.png)

   > **Note**: If your data source is an on-premises file, a data gateway is required for refresh. In this lab environment, review the **Gateway and cloud connections** section and note whether a gateway is configured.

1. Expand the **Refresh** section.

1. Toggle **Configure a refresh schedule** (Keep your data up to date) to **On (2)**.

1. Configure the schedule as follows:

   - **Refresh frequency (3)**: Daily
   - **Time zone (1)**: Select your local time zone
   - Click **Add another time (4)** and set a refresh time, such as **8:00 AM**

     ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T6S4.png)

1. Enable the **Send refresh failure notifications** option so the dataset owner is notified when a refresh fails.

   ![](./Images/images/exercise-1/L2E1T6S5.png)
